“wrap” discussions as research log, todo’s with hardness levels.
(it remembers where you have done anything, of course, but details should be at least duplicated on new familysearch)

(the ideal would be “subscribe to your ancestors discussions, etc., and maybe all of their descendants, and it can show “there are 3 todo lists up this way in the tree, 44 down this way from him” (which we could cache, at least…}
if you wanted to do all, you could just cache all up, and “lines of interest” down…just things that have been viewed ever count

it can show “there is someone up the tree this way” (realtime seeing…)
one can “show the other” something…(control their view)

verified checkboxes

the tree itself can show pictures, stories, (my “related” pictures from the family history screen saver)
the “living” tree 

zoom inable pictures, like harry potter!

bookmarks (shareable), public/tags
self notes
self history

show if people have discussions.

be “fast” (cacheing ancestors likely to be viewed?)

“global view” of your whole tree, here’s where you are in it.

 “follow” so and so’s changes/genealogical updates
“post” changes to facebook, too.
follow their trail?
see other peoples' todo list/bookmarks.

can upload images LOL

research that other site
