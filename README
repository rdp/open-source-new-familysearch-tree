ideas:

bookmarks, private notes, links in to the real thing

link to werelate

bookmarks


“wrap” discussions as research log, todo’s with hardness levels.
(it remembers where you have done anything, of course, but details should be at least duplicated on new familysearch)

(the ideal would be “subscribe to your ancestors discussions, etc., and maybe all of their descendants, and it can show “there are 3 todo lists up this way in the tree, 44 down this way from him” (which we could cache, at least…}
if you wanted to do all, you could just cache all up, and “lines of interest” down…just things that have been viewed ever count

it can show “there is someone up the tree this way” (realtime seeing…)
one can “show the other” something…(control their view)

verified checkboxes

the tree itself can show pictures, stories, (my “related” pictures from the family history screen saver)
the “living” tree 

zoom inable pictures, like harry potter!

bookmarks (shareable), public/tags
self notes
self history

show if people have discussions.

be “fast” (cacheing ancestors likely to be viewed?)

“global view” of your whole tree, here’s where you are in it.

 “follow” so and so’s changes/genealogical updates
“post” changes to facebook, too.
follow their trail?
see other peoples' todo list/bookmarks.

can upload images LOL

research that other site
  they wrap new familysearch
  they have some interesting ideas
  realtime search as you type, "these ancestors are only missing one thing!" [I assume that's an API they can call or what?]

maybe a "here's how to find some more information on them" (various resources, helps)

can click into wikipedia for that place

super visualizer on a grid or...on a global map yeah.

me "save/cache" all the people/relationships...to make things super speedier-o LOL.
And offline download all their ancestors for them, why not? :P
